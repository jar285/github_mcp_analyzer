Architectural Design: GitHub Repository Analyzer MCP Server
===========================================================

System Components
-----------------

The GitHub Repository Analyzer is built with a modular architecture consisting of four main components:

### 1\. MCP Server

This is the core component that implements the Model Context Protocol and acts as the interface between LLM clients and the GitHub API. The MCP Server:

-   Registers and exposes tools and resources
-   Handles communication with LLM clients
-   Manages authentication and session state
-   Processes requests and returns responses in MCP-compatible formats

### 2\. GitHub API Client

This component handles all interactions with the GitHub API, including:

-   Authentication with GitHub
-   Making API requests
-   Handling rate limiting
-   Error management and retries
-   Parsing GitHub responses

### 3\. Analysis Tools

These are specialized functions that perform specific analysis tasks:

-   Repository information retrieval
-   Issue listing and analysis
-   Commit history extraction
-   Activity metrics calculation
-   Chart and visualization generation

### 4\. Data Resources

These provide access to repository data as resources:

-   README content
-   Repository documentation
-   Other file content as needed

Component Interaction Flow
--------------------------

1.  **User Request**: A user asks an LLM client (like Claude Desktop) a question about a GitHub repository
2.  **Tool Discovery**: The LLM client queries the MCP Server to discover available tools
3.  **Tool Selection**: The LLM determines which tools are needed to answer the user's question
4.  **Tool Invocation**: The LLM client calls the appropriate tools on the MCP Server
5.  **GitHub Interaction**: The MCP Server uses the GitHub API Client to retrieve requested data
6.  **Data Processing**: The server processes and analyzes the raw GitHub data
7.  **Response Generation**: The processed data is returned to the LLM client
8.  **User Response**: The LLM client uses the data to generate an informed response for the user

```

Tool Architecture
-----------------

Each tool in the system follows a standard pattern:

1.  **Input Definition**: Clearly defined parameters (e.g., repository name, time period)
2.  **Processing Logic**: The analysis or retrieval logic that uses the GitHub API
3.  **Output Formatting**: Structured response that's useful for LLM interpretation
4.  **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API limits, authentication issues, and other potential errors

Security Considerations
-----------------------

The architecture incorporates several security measures:

-   GitHub API tokens are stored as environment variables, not hardcoded
-   The server only exposes specific, controlled functionality
-   API requests are limited to explicitly requested repositories
-   Error messages are designed to avoid leaking sensitive information

Extensibility Design
--------------------

The system is designed to be extensible:

-   New tools can be added by creating additional functions
-   Existing tools can be enhanced without disrupting the overall architecture
-   Additional API integrations could be added beyond GitHub
