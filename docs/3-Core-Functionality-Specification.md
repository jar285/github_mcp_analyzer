Core Functionality Specifications: GitHub Repository Analyzer MCP Server
========================================================================

This document outlines the core tools and resources that the GitHub Repository Analyzer MCP server will provide. Each functionality is described in terms of its purpose, inputs, outputs, and implementation considerations.

1\. Repository Information Tool
-------------------------------

**Purpose:** Retrieve basic metadata about a GitHub repository.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")

**Outputs:**

-   Repository name
-   Description
-   Owner information
-   Star count
-   Fork count
-   Watcher count
-   Open issue count
-   Primary language
-   License information
-   Creation and last update dates
-   Visibility (public/private)
-   Repository URL

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Handle repositories that don't exist
-   Provide meaningful error messages
-   Consider rate limiting impacts

2\. Issue Analysis Tool
-----------------------

**Purpose:** List and categorize repository issues.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")
-   Issue state (open, closed, all)
-   Maximum number of issues to return

**Outputs:**

-   List of issues with:
    -   Issue number
    -   Title
    -   State
    -   Creation and update dates
    -   Author
    -   Labels
    -   Comment count
    -   Issue URL

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Handle repositories with no issues
-   Support pagination for repositories with many issues
-   Filter options for more targeted analysis

3\. README Access Resource
--------------------------

**Purpose:** Provide access to repository documentation.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")

**Outputs:**

-   README content as text
-   File path
-   URL to the raw file

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Handle repositories without a README
-   Support various README formats (md, rst, txt)
-   Consider large README files

4\. Commit History Tool
-----------------------

**Purpose:** Analyze recent code changes.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")
-   Number of days to look back
-   Maximum number of commits to return

**Outputs:**

-   List of commits with:
    -   Commit hash
    -   Commit message
    -   Author name
    -   Commit date
    -   URL to the commit
    -   Stats (additions, deletions, total changes)

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Handle repositories with many commits
-   Support filtering by time period
-   Consider performance for large repositories

5\. Activity Analysis Tool
--------------------------

**Purpose:** Calculate repository activity metrics.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")
-   Time period for analysis (in days)

**Outputs:**

-   Commit count
-   Opened issues count
-   Closed issues count
-   Opened pull request count
-   Merged pull request count
-   Unique contributor count
-   List of contributors

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Handle repositories with little or no activity
-   Balance between detailed metrics and performance
-   Consider GitHub API limitations

6\. Visualization Tool
----------------------

**Purpose:** Create visual charts of repository activity.

**Inputs:**

-   Repository name (format: "username/repository")
-   Time period (in days)

**Outputs:**

-   Image showing commit activity over time

**Implementation Considerations:**

-   Generate clear, informative visuals
-   Handle repositories with uneven activity patterns
-   Consider performance impacts of chart generation

Error Handling Approach
-----------------------

All tools should implement consistent error handling:

1.  Specific error messages for common issues (repository not found, authentication problems)
2.  Graceful handling of GitHub API limitations
3.  Clear indication of when data might be incomplete due to API constraints
4.  Fallback mechanisms where appropriate

Tool Registration
-----------------

Each tool should be registered with the MCP server with:

1.  Clear, descriptive name
2.  Comprehensive description of functionality
3.  Well-documented parameters
4.  Expected return types and formats
